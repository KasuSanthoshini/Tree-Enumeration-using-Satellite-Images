# Tree Enumeration using Satellite Images

Efficient forest land management for development mandates a precise evaluation of tree
populations, pivotal for informed decision-making. This challenge necessitates an
advanced image analytics solution harnessing computer vision to automate tree
enumeration via satellite imagery or aerial photographs. Key focal points encompass
meticulous Image Data Analysis, accommodating diverse species, sizes, and
environmental nuances, along with precise Tree Counting and Categorization. The solution
prioritizes accuracy, validated against ground-truth data, and accentuates Scalability,
Efficiency, Integration, and Visualization. Ethical considerations underscore data privacy,
environmental impact mitigation, and compliance, fostering a framework for responsible
and sustainable development.
